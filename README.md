# Xemph: XMP Parser

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gbm-bailleul/xemph.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gbm-bailleul/xemph)

## Abstract

This project is just a new XMP parser. It has been inspired of the xmpbox module in Apache PDFBox project. 
On the contrary of Xmpbox, I did not try keep compatibility with the Jempbox.

## Example

TODO

## Format

Only XML parsing and writing is implemented
